# Converting .py into .exe with PyInstaller
Install pyinstaller:
pip install pyinstaller
or
python -m pip install pyinstaller

Send your file to the python path (py -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)") and cd

run the following command (change my_script to your script name):
python -m PyInstaller my_script.py

2 folders will be created, build and dist. Build will have just logs of the build and can be deleted.
Dist is the one to distribute
